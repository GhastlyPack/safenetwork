  <div class="prose">

    <p>Counterfeit coins are a real problem, and new collectors are the most common victims. I have seen it happen too many times - someone buys what looks like a beautiful Silver Eagle or a stunning Morgan Dollar, then finds out it is plated copper that is worth almost nothing. The good news is that catching fakes is not hard once you know what to look for. You do not need expensive equipment. You need a few simple tools, about five minutes, and the knowledge in this article.</p>

    <div class="warn-box">
      <h4>Do Not Skip This Step</h4>
      <p>Counterfeit coins are most common on peer-to-peer marketplaces, flea markets, and estate sales where sellers may not know - or care - what they actually have. Always run at least two authentication tests on any coin you buy outside of a reputable dealer or graded slab.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>The Four Core Authentication Tests</h2>
    <p>No single test is foolproof on its own. Sophisticated counterfeiters have learned to pass individual checks. Running all four tests together gives you a very high level of confidence before any money changes hands.</p>

    <div class="test-grid">
      <div class="test-card pass">
        <span class="test-icon">⚖️</span>
        <h3>Weight Test</h3>
        <p>Every genuine coin has a precise, published weight. A scale accurate to 0.1 grams costs about $10 and is the single most reliable tool in your kit.</p>
        <span class="verdict verdict-pass">MOST RELIABLE</span>
      </div>
      <div class="test-card pass">
        <span class="test-icon">🧲</span>
        <h3>Magnet Test</h3>
        <p>Real silver and gold are not magnetic. A strong neodymium magnet will immediately reveal most low-quality fakes made from steel or iron.</p>
        <span class="verdict verdict-pass">FAST &amp; FREE</span>
      </div>
      <div class="test-card pass">
        <span class="test-icon">🔔</span>
        <h3>Sound Test</h3>
        <p>Genuine silver produces a clear, sustained ring when tapped or dropped. Base metal fakes produce a dull, flat thud with no resonance.</p>
        <span class="verdict verdict-pass">EASY TO LEARN</span>
      </div>
      <div class="test-card">
        <span class="test-icon">🔍</span>
        <h3>Visual Inspection</h3>
        <p>Details like edge reeding, surface texture, and design sharpness can reveal fakes that pass other tests. A loupe or magnifying glass helps significantly.</p>
        <span class="verdict verdict-warn">REQUIRES PRACTICE</span>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Weight Test</h2>
    <p>This is your most important tool. Every coin ever minted has a precisely documented weight, and counterfeit coins almost never match it exactly. A kitchen scale accurate to 0.1 grams is all you need - you can find one for under $15 on Amazon.</p>
    <p>Here are the exact weights for the most commonly faked coins:</p>

    <table class="spec-table">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Coin</th><th>Weight</th><th>Diameter</th><th>Thickness</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>American Silver Eagle (1 oz)</td><td>31.103 g</td><td>40.6 mm</td><td>2.98 mm</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Morgan Dollar</td><td>26.73 g</td><td>38.1 mm</td><td>2.4 mm</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Peace Dollar</td><td>26.73 g</td><td>38.1 mm</td><td>2.4 mm</td></tr>
        <tr><td>American Gold Eagle (1 oz)</td><td>33.93 g</td><td>32.7 mm</td><td>2.87 mm</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Canadian Maple Leaf (1 oz silver)</td><td>31.11 g</td><td>38.0 mm</td><td>3.29 mm</td></tr>
        <tr><td>90% Silver Dime (Roosevelt/Mercury)</td><td>2.50 g</td><td>17.9 mm</td><td>-</td></tr>
        <tr><td>90% Silver Quarter</td><td>6.25 g</td><td>24.3 mm</td><td>-</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>If a coin is off by more than 0.3 grams from its published weight, treat it as suspect and run every other test before trusting it. A coin that fails the weight test should never be purchased regardless of how good it looks.</p>

    <div class="inline-img">⚖️</div>

    <h2>Magnet Test</h2>
    <p>Silver and gold are not magnetic. Neither is copper, which makes up the core of most legitimate coins. Steel and iron - the most common materials used in cheap counterfeits - are strongly magnetic. A neodymium rare earth magnet, available for a few dollars online, will stick hard to any steel fake the moment you bring it close.</p>
    <p>Here is how to run the test properly:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hold the coin flat in one hand</li>
      <li>Bring the magnet close slowly - do not slam it onto the coin</li>
      <li>A genuine silver coin will show zero attraction</li>
      <li>A steel fake will pull noticeably toward the magnet or stick entirely</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="info-box">
      <h4>The Slide Test for Advanced Checking</h4>
      <p>Silver is slightly diamagnetic, meaning it actually repels magnetic fields weakly. If you tilt a coin at about 45 degrees and slide a strong magnet down its face, a genuine silver coin will slow the magnet slightly as it passes. A plated copper or zinc fake will let the magnet slide freely at full speed. This takes practice but is a useful secondary check for coins that pass the basic magnet test.</p>
    </div>

    <blockquote>"The magnet test takes three seconds and costs nothing if you already own a magnet. There is no reason not to run it on every single coin you buy outside of a certified slab."</blockquote>

    <h2>Sound Test</h2>
    <p>Real silver has a distinct acoustic signature. When you tap a genuine silver coin with another coin or drop it onto a hard surface, it produces a clear, bell-like ring that sustains for a moment. Base metals produce a dull, dead thud with almost no resonance.</p>
    <p>The easiest way to learn this is to tap a known genuine Silver Eagle against another genuine coin, then listen carefully. Once you hear the real ring, fakes become obvious. You can also find audio comparisons online - searching "silver coin ring test" on YouTube will give you dozens of examples in minutes.</p>
    <p>The sound test is particularly useful for Morgan Dollars and Peace Dollars, where the large silver content produces a very pronounced ring that base metal fakes simply cannot replicate.</p>

    <!-- REPLACE: Upload a close-up photo of coin edge reeding detail to Cloudinary -->
    <div class="inline-img">🔍</div>

    <h2>Visual Inspection</h2>
    <p>A good loupe or magnifying glass in the 5x to 10x range lets you examine details that are impossible to fake at scale. Here is what to look for:</p>

    <h3>Edge Reeding</h3>
    <p>Most silver dollars and Eagles have reeded edges - the ridged pattern around the circumference. On genuine coins, the reeding is sharp, consistent, and evenly spaced. On fakes, reeding is often shallow, uneven, or missing sections. Run your thumbnail around the edge and feel for consistency.</p>

    <h3>Surface Texture and Luster</h3>
    <p>Genuine mint-state coins have a distinctive cartwheel luster - a flowing, directional shine that moves as you rotate the coin under light. Plated fakes tend to have a flat, uniform shine without that depth. Circulated genuine coins have natural wear patterns on the high points of the design. Fakes often show artificial wear or strange surface textures that do not match how genuine coins age.</p>

    <h3>Design Sharpness</h3>
    <p>Cast counterfeits - made by pouring metal into a mold - almost always show slightly mushy or rounded design details compared to struck originals. Look closely at fine details like hair strands, feathers on Eagles, or lettering serifs. Genuine struck coins have crisp, sharp definition at these points. Casts do not.</p>

    <h3>Color and Tone</h3>
    <p>Silver has a specific gray-white color with natural toning that develops over time. Plated fakes often show a slightly different hue, or the plating starts to wear through at the high points revealing a different color underneath. Look at the rims and the highest relief points of the design first - those are where plating fails earliest.</p>

    <h2>Buying from Reputable Sellers</h2>
    <p>The most reliable protection against counterfeit coins is simply buying from sellers you can trust. On Whatnot, look for sellers with strong feedback scores, established show histories, and a willingness to answer authentication questions on stream. Buying graded coins in PCGS or NGC slabs eliminates counterfeit risk entirely for those pieces - the grading services authenticate every coin before encapsulating it.</p>
    <p>At Safe Network, every coin that goes through our shows is handled by experienced collectors who know what they are looking at. That is not a guarantee against every possible error - no one can promise that - but it is a meaningful layer of protection that buying from an anonymous seller simply cannot offer.</p>
